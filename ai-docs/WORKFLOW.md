# Workflow Guide

This guide is copied to `ai-docs/WORKFLOW.md` by bootstrap so a
maintainer can preserve the project shape when plugin skills or MCP tools are not
available. It is an explanation and manual fallback only: editing this file does
not change MCP parser behavior, plugin/runtime semantics, ticket status logic,
spec indexing, or any other machine contract.

When this guide and installed plugin tooling disagree, treat the installed plugin,
runtime, and bundled conventions as canonical. Update the upstream bootstrap
template rather than relying on a project-local guide override.

## Authority Files

- `AGENTS.md` is the canonical root workflow context for AI agents and automation.
- `CLAUDE.md` exists only for Claude compatibility and should contain
  `@AGENTS.md` when the project has migrated to the host-neutral context.
- `ai-docs/WORKFLOW.md` is this pinned guide for plugin-less
  maintenance. Keep root context short; put durable project orientation in
  `AGENTS.md`'s `## Project Orientation` section, procedures in
  `ai-docs/manuals/`, volatile session context in the `repo` note layer, and
  workflow-system changes in upstream tooling.

## `ai-docs/` Layout

- `AGENTS.md`'s `## Project Orientation` section is the every-session
  orientation: repo identity, project map/topology, and canonical flows. Keep
  it compact; route deep detail to specs, mental models, or manuals.
- `manuals/` stores procedures and how-to content, one file per procedure with
  a `summary:` frontmatter line describing when it applies; a `*.local.md`
  sibling (gitignored) holds machine-local procedure content such as
  credentials, IPs, hostnames, or host-specific runbooks.
- `ws-notes/` is the git-tracked `repo` note layer, one file per key. It holds
  volatile or tracked session context; prune stale entries qualitatively as
  the project advances.
- `tickets/` stores work by status directory: `idea/`, `todo/`, `ready/`,
  `.done/`, and `.dropped/`.
- `spec/` stores caller-visible behavior specs with stable stem anchors.
- `mental-model.md` stores the mental-model index and optional project reading
  map; `mental-model/` stores modification-relevant operational knowledge and
  domain rules.
- `ref/` stores static references that are not active workflow state.
- `.old/` stores tracked project archive material kept only as possible future
  reference and hidden from default listings.
- `WORKFLOW.md` is this human-readable fallback guide.

## Tickets

- Reference tickets by stem, never by path; stems stay stable when tickets move
  between status directories.
- `idea/` is rough intake, `todo/` is accepted backlog, and `ready/` is the
  spec-addressed implementation-ready status.
- Actionable tickets use `## Phases` with stable `### Phase N: <title>`
  headings. Research tickets may use freeform topic sections.
- After a phase has a `### Result` section, treat its plan text and existing
  result entries as frozen. Add later implementation tweaks as a
  `#### Edition` entry under that Result area.
- Move tickets with `git mv` when possible so history preserves status changes.

## Specs

- Specs describe caller-visible behavior, not implementation details that can
  change without changing behavior.
- Each behavior entry uses a stable `{#YYMMDD-slug}` anchor. The anchor stem is
  the identifier used in tickets, commits, and mental-model cross-references.
- Planned work stays in ticket `## Spec Impact` until implementation closeout;
  spec entries describe implemented behavior only. Verify the behavior exists
  before writing or keeping its entry. A known-but-unscheduled gap with no
  ticket is the exception: it stays as a
  `> [!note] Implementation Gap · YYYY-MM-DD` callout, and a verification pass
  keeps it rather than deleting it.
- If stem-generation or duplicate-anchor tools are unavailable, choose a clear
  date-prefixed stem manually, search the spec tree for duplicates, and verify
  with plugin tooling when it becomes available.

## Mental Models

- Mental models capture knowledge needed to safely modify the project: module
  contracts, coupling, extension recipes, common mistakes, and technical debt.
- The root `mental-model.md` may include a compact project reading map that
  routes task/topic intents to specs, mental-model docs, references, or lookup
  guidance. It must not become a current build inventory.
- Domain-scoped user rules belong in `## Domain Rules` inside the matching
  mental-model document, not in root `AGENTS.md`.
- If a domain has nested documents, read the parent `index.md` before any child
  document so inherited domain rules are visible.
- Include relevant spec stems in mental-model prose so future agents can trace
  operational guidance back to caller-visible behavior.

## Index Health

`ai-docs/_index.md` is a legacy all-in-one memory file. Current projects route
every-session orientation into `AGENTS.md`'s `## Project Orientation` section,
procedures into `ai-docs/manuals/`, volatile or tracked session context into
the `repo` note layer, and ticket/spec inventory into generated project-tree
output; they do not have an `_index.md`. This section only applies to a
project that still has one, until it runs the bootstrap migration item that
dissolves it.

When `ai-docs/_index.md` exists, bootstrap reports scope-drift candidates as
an advisory health note and asks whether to clean up now, defer cleanup, or
migrate to the current model. The first pass reads `_index.md` only; it does
not load the full spec or mental-model corpus and does not move semantic
content.

Common drift candidates:

- deep source trees, file-by-file roles, type listings, or implementation inventory;
- long behavior inventories that belong in specs or a linked "what works" doc;
- data-flow narratives, lifecycle descriptions, extension recipes, common
  mistakes, audit rules, or logging rules that belong in mental models;
- dependency API notes, archived design excerpts, or external-reference summaries;
- done/dropped ticket history, completed milestones, or stale session chronology;
- stable task/topic reading maps mixed into `_index.md`;
- long duplicated spec, mental-model, module, or ticket indexes.

When a maintainer approves cleanup, prefer the dissolution migration (move
`_index.md` content into `AGENTS.md`'s `## Project Orientation`, the `repo`
note layer, and `ai-docs/manuals/`, then delete `_index.md`) over a partial
in-place compaction. If a maintainer only wants a lighter compaction pass
instead of full dissolution:

1. Preserve the memory-policy comment.
2. Keep project summary, stack, top-level workspace, build/test commands,
   read-before-edit pointers, active inventory, and compact
   session notes.
3. Compact deep sections into links only when a clear owning document already
   exists.
4. Keep unique project direction, active priorities, and unresolved operational
   caveats in `_index.md`.
5. Do not author or semantically update specs, mental models, tickets, or refs
   during index cleanup.
6. Compact source-derived detail to source pointers, static material to
   `ai-docs/ref/` or API-doc pointers, work history to Git or ticket archives,
   and duplicated maps to start-here pointers.
7. Route deeper semantic work through the owning workflow: behavior into
   `ai-docs/spec/`, modification knowledge into `ai-docs/mental-model/`,
   ticket readiness/status wording into the ticket body, and ambiguous
   direction to a discussion pass.

## Commit Traceability

- Every AI-authored commit should include `## AI Context` explaining why the
  approach was chosen and what alternatives or constraints mattered.
- Ticket-driven commits may include `## Ticket Updates` with forward-facing
  findings for future phases.
- Behavior-changing commits should include `## Spec` entries naming affected
  spec stems. If a spec anchor is renamed, record
  `renamed-spec: <old-stem> -> <new-stem>`.

## Manual Fallback

When workflow skills, MCP tools, or Claude compatibility commands are unavailable:

1. Read `AGENTS.md`, this guide, and the relevant current docs.
2. Use existing nearby tickets, specs, and mental models as formatting examples.
3. Prefer conservative, append-only changes when parser behavior is uncertain.
4. Keep generated AI docs and commit messages in English unless a human-facing
   product string requires another language.
5. Verify with plain Git and shell commands, then re-run plugin verification
   tools when they become available.
